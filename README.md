The repo contains my work for the course project of Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

# Project Summary
======================================================
The script contain a function run.analysis.R that perform jobs on:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# About the Code Book

CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
